## Overall Conclusion:
The project demonstrates a strong foundation in certain areas of data analytics, particularly in data collection, cleaning, exploratory analysis, and feature engineering. The use of Jupyter Notebooks and Tableau Public to handle data and present insights is executed effectively, showcasing the learner's ability to manipulate and analyze data with modern tools and Python libraries. Key aspects of the project, such as data cleaning, data visualization, and exploratory data analysis, are well-executed, demonstrating practical skills in handling real-world datasets.

However, significant and essential components are missing, preventing the project from reaching the pass level:
- **Absence of Machine Learning Analysis**: There is no machine learning (ML) model development, evaluation, or optimization. Without any ML analysis, the project lacks the critical application of predictive modeling and fails to fulfill a major requirement of applying data analytics techniques to real-world problems. The process of choosing an optimal model, training, validating, and forecasting—essential tasks in data analytics—is completely absent. This is a major shortcoming that directly affects several learning outcomes.
- **Ethics Considerations Not Addressed**: The project also lacks coverage of ethical considerations (LO6). There is no discussion of data privacy, governance, or the legal and social implications of data handling. Given the importance of ethics in data analytics, this is a significant omission.
- **Unaddressed Hypothesis 2**: The absence of Hypothesis 2 testing further weakens the project. This hypothesis aimed to test whether sales increase in stores with larger sizes or specific store types, and without this analysis, the project fails to fully evaluate and validate the proposed hypotheses. Missing this analysis not only affects the project’s completeness but also reduces the depth of the overall evaluation.

Therefore, even if the current content is well-executed, the absence of these critical parts prevents the project from achieving a pass level. The project is classified as **below par** and does not meet the criteria for passing.
